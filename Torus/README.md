### This Project is heavily inspired by Lex Fridman's video about Spinning Torus

## Lex Fridman's youtube video uses Andy Sloane's work to create a Torus that spins using C .

I have not added anything to this project, I am simply creating this for myself, and eventually I want to deploy this on a webpage.
The sole reason is becuase I think this is really cool! :D
